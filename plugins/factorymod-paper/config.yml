#FactoryMod configuration file

#FactoryMod is a Spigot plugin, which allows players to setup predefined factories for an item cost. There are various
#factories with different purposes and pretty much everything about them is configurable. Their configuration is 
#handled within this file. Take great care to ensure that your configurations follow exactly the documentation provided
#here, otherwise unwanted effects/crashes and run time exceptions may occur.

#----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

#Specifying items:

#Very often in this config you will have to specify items for a configuration. All item specifications are lists of 
#configurations, which contain information about the actual item, like this:

#inputmaterials:
#   inputmat1:
#       material: STONE
#   inputmat345FF:
#       material: DIRT

#Ensure that the identifer (here inputmat1 or inputmat345FF) all have the same intendation and never use duplicate
#identifers on the same level. Duplicate identifers which belong to a different configuration section are a bad habit,
#but should still work, while duplicate identifers on the same level will definitely not lead to the result you desire.
#This applies for every configuration option and not only for items. When you are required to specify a list of items
#you can also just put the option for it there, but not actually any identifers below it to list items and it will
#result in no cost/output.

#An example item config utilizing all possiblities could look like this:

#inputmat1:
#   material: STONE
#   durability: 3
#   amount: 456
#   name: SuperSpecialStone
#   lore:
#    - First lore line
#    - Even more lore
#   enchants:
#       enchantidentifier1:
#           enchant: SILK_TOUCH
#           level: 1
#       enchantgharbbl:
#           enchant: DAMAGE_ALL
#           level: 5


#material requires you to specify the type of the item. Use Spigot's official item identifers here, a full list of those
#can be found here: https://hub.spigotmc.org/javadocs/spigot/org/bukkit/Material.html

#durability allows you to specify the durability of the item. Note that this is not only limited to the durability of tools
#or armour, but instead the durability is also used to create different variations of the same material. For example orange
#wool is actually just white wool with a durability of 1. If this option is not specified it will default to 0, which is also
#minecraft's default durability for items. If you don't want to limit an item to a specific durability, but for example want to
#require any type of wool as an input, use -1 as durability. Make sure to only use this for inputs though, if you let a factory
#output an itemstack for players with a durability of -1, the item will be glitched. For a full list of all items and their 
#durabilities use this site: http://minecraft-ids.grahamedgecombe.com/

#amount allows you to specify the amount of the item, this isn't limited to 64 or whatever the maximum stack size of that
#item is, it can be any number (assuming it fits into an int). If not specfied this option will default to 1

#name allows you to define a custom name for this item, if this option is not set the item will have its vanilla name

#lore allows you to list lore which is added to the item. There is no limit to the lines of lore here, but after too many the
#minecraft client will stop display them properly. Defining lore is completly optional.

#Finally enchants allows you to list all the enchants wanted on this item, each enchant requires it's own config identifer.

#The two options requires per enchant are relatively straight forward, first of all you need to specify the enchantment type
#with it's spigot identifer. https://hub.spigotmc.org/javadocs/spigot/org/bukkit/enchantments/Enchantment.html provides a
#full list of those. Second you will need to specify the level you want the desired enchantment to be, this may exceed the
#possibilites of vanilla without causing problems.

#----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
#General

#This section allows you to define global default values and some general stuff. 

#First of all under the crafting option you can disable existing 
#vanilla crafting recipes here and enable new custom recipes.

#An example to disable recipes:

#crafting:
#   disabled:
#       firstdisabledidentifer:
#           material: TORCH
#       crackedStoneBrick:
#           material: SMOOTH_BRICK
#           durability: 2

#Basically you only need to give a list of items here and all their crafting recipes will be disabled

#To enable new crafting recipes 

#TODO TODO TODO TODO TODO


crafting:
    disabled:
    enabled:


#Additionally you can specify default options here, which are applied to all factories which use this option, unless
#you chose to overwrite the default for a specific factory, in that case the option specified in the factories config 
#will apply to it.

#The first option here is default_update_time. The update time describes how often a factory is ticked, ergo how often
#it checks whether it still has enough fuel, enough other resources to run and so on. This is basically the smallest
#time unit within your factory can possibly react and all other time values your factory works with should be multiples
#of this value. If they are not a multiple of this value, their de-facto value will be the next higher multiple of the
#update time, simply because whatever effect they have can only be applied if the factory is actually ticked. Note that
#this value highly influences the performance of this plugin, if FactoryMod is consuming more server power than you want
#it to, the first step should be to make this value higher. Recommended value is 1 second

default_update_time: 1s


#With the option default_fuel you can specify the default fuel for all factories which are consuming fuel in a furnace
#while running. This doesn't have to be a vanilla furnace fuel, but can be any item instead. A factory may chose to over
#write this option

default_fuel:
    charcoal:
        material: COAL
        durability: 1
 

#default_fuel_consumption_intervall specifies a default for how often factories consume fuel. Basically every time a 
#factory which consumes fuel has run for the time specified here, one fuel unit will be consumed. This value should
#always be a multiple of the updatetime and a factory may chose to specify it's own value and not use the default value

default_fuel_consumption_intervall: 2s

#default_menu_factory allows you to specify the menu for which factory will be opened when a player runs /fm without 
#specifying a factory. If this is not specified and the player runs "/fm" one will be picked randomly.
default_menu_factory:

#As a debug mode or to prevent additional information when tracking down bugs this plugin can log all of its inventory 
#interactions and the full inventories at that point, if desired. If this option is not specified it will default to true

log_inventories: true


#Additionally this plugin can disable vanilla nether portals. This isn't really part of the plugin's core functionality,
#but it was picked up from the first implementation of FactoryMod and stayed here after it's rewrite. Deal with it.
disable_nether: false


#When FCCs are in disrepair they will be removed after a set amount of time, which can be specified here
break_grace_period: 7d


#How often factories are passively decayed
decay_intervall: 1h

#How much health is decayed from factories, factories have 10k health total
decay_amount: 21

#Whether the yaml identifier or the factory name should be used when assigning recipes to factories, default to false
use_recipe_yamlidentifiers: false

#How often factory data is saved automatically. Recommended value and default is 15 minutes. Set to -1 to disable
saving_intervall: 15m


#----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
#Factories

#The main part of this plugin's functionality will be defined by this section as it specifies most of the configuration
#for your factories. Under the option factories you will be required to specify each factories configuration, each factory
#needs it's own identifier here, an example could look like this:

#factories:
#   IAmAnIdentifer:
#       type: FCC
#       name: Stone Smelter
#   SoAmI:
#       type: PIPE
#       name: Pipinator

#All factories have in common that they require you to define a type and a name. The type must be one of the predefined 
#options explained further below to specify the physical appearance and the broad functionality of the factory.
#The name can be any string, which will be used to identify this factory at a later point. There may be many different
#factories of the same type with different names with completly different configurations, but ingame factories with
#the same name are guaranteed to have the same functionality. Because of that NEVER EVER duplicate factory names, not 
#even if their type is different.

#Currently there are three different types of factories:

#1. FCC

#FCC is an acronym for FurnaceCraftingTableChest, which is the "classic" factory and what factories used to be in the first
#version of FactoryMod before its rewrite. As you might guess it consist of a crafting table, a furnace and a chest. The
#crafting table has to be in the middle between the furnace and the chest either vertical or horizontal. Those factories
#use an item which is burned in furnace as fuel to execute recipes, which usually use up some sort of item in the chest
#to produce another. A factory can have as many recipes as you want, the details for those are defined further down in the
#config. The identifier used for this type of factory in the config is FCC. An example config to explain every possible
#option for this factory:

#smelteridentiferbla:
#   type: FCC
#   name: Smelter
#   updatetime: 2s
#   fuel:
#       fuelidentifier:
#           material: COAL
#           durability: 1
#   fuel_consumption_intervall: 10s
#   setupcost:
#       dirt:
#           material: DIRT
#           amount: 64
#       stone:
#           material: STONE
#           amount: 64
#   recipes:
#    - Smelt iron ore
#    - Smelt diamond ore
#    - Smelt stone
#    - Upgrade smelter

#type and name work as already described above

#updatetime decides how often this factory is ticked to check whether it still has all the materials required, fuel etc.
#If this is not specified the default option which was specified above will be used. For more details on this option read
#the explaination next to the default updatetime above

#fuel specifies which item is used in the furnace to power this factory. You will still need to give the fuel it's own
#sub identifer here, because it's techincally part of a list of items. If this option is not set, the default fuel specified
#above will be used.

#fuel_consumption_intervall describes how often fuel is consumed if the factory is running with any recipe. If it is not set,   
#the default fuel consumption intervall specified above will be used.

#setupcost are the materials the player will need to create this factory. Two factories may not have the exact same setupcost,
#otherwise there is no way to determine which factory a player actually intended to setup.

#recipes is the option which defines what this FCC actually does, but you are only supposed to list the names of the
#recipes this factory is meant to run here. The exact functionality of the recipes is defined further below, ensure that the
#names given to the recipes are identical with the ones used here, even the capitalization has to be the same. The same recipe
#may be used by multiple factories or exist in the config without being used by any factory.


#Additionally it is also possible to upgrade factories, which turns the factory into a completly different one after a specific
#recipe. To do so, the upgraded version must be added to the list of factories with FCCUPGRADE as the type identifier. Example:

#upgradedsmelter:
#   type: FCCUPGRADE
#   name: Upgraded Smelter
#   updatetime: 2s
#   fuel:
#       fuelidentifier:
#           material: COAL
#           durability: 1
#   fuel_consumption_intervall: 10s
#   recipes:
#    - Smelt emerald ore

#As you can see this is pretty much identical to a normal factory aside from the type and the fact that an upgraded factory
#does not specify a setup cost. The actual upgrade cost will be contained in the recipe which is used to upgrade the factory


#2. Pipe

#Pipes allow players to transport items over longer distances. This is meant to replace hopper chains, which can have heavy
#impact on the server performance. The pipes themselves consist of a dropper, which represents the start point of the pipe
#and it's pumper, a furnace to consume fuel while transporting, the actual pipe consisting of stained glass blocks and a target 
#block with an inventory.

#An example config for a pipe:

#thisIsAPipeIdentifer123:
#   type: PIPE
#   name: Example Pipe
#   updatetime: 2s
#   setupcost:
#       redstone:
#           material: REDSTONE
#           amount 64
#   fuel:
#       normalcoal:
#           material: COAL
#   fuel_consumption_intervall: 5s
#   transfer_time_multiplier: 1s
#   transferamount: 16
#   glass_color: 1

#type for all pipes must be PIPE and name a unique identifer, standard stuff

#update time specifies how often this factory is ticked, see default_update_time for a detailed description of updatetimes
#functionality

#setupcost are the items required in the dropper when creating this factory

#fuel specifies the fuel the pipe uses up while transferring, standard as described above

#fuel_consumption_intervall specifies how often fuel is consumed, again this works exactly as described above

#transfer_time_multiplier defines how long the pipe takes to transfer one load of items. The total transportation time scales
#directly with the length of the pipe and the value specified here multiplied with the length of the pipe (only counting
#glass blocks) results in the total transportation time per batch. For example if you set this value to one second, a pipe
#which is 10 blocks long will take 10 seconds to transport a batch of items.

#transferamount is the total amount of items transferred per batch. 

#glass_color is the durability value of the glass this pipe is supposed to have. For a full list see:
#http://minecraft.gamepedia.com/Stained_Glass#Block_data


#3. Sorter

#Sorters allow players to sort item from a single dispenser into different other containers. What gets sorted where is
#completly up to the player, the factory itself only consists of a dispenser and a furnace. The dispenser is the main block of 
#the factory which contains the items which will be sorted and the blocks in which will be sorted have to be adjacent to it.
#The furnace simply consumes fuel to power the factory, like it's done for other factories as well. An example config:

#fkIsGonnaLikeThis:
#   type: SORTER
#   name: The first sorter
#   updatetime: 2s
#   fuel:
#       normalcoal:
#           material: COAL
#   fuel_consumption_intervall: 5s
#   setupcost:
#       redblocks:
#           material: REDSTONE_BLOCK
#           amount: 64
#   sort_time: 2s
#   sort_amount: 32
#   maximum_materials_per_side: 20


# type, name, updatetime, fuel and fuel_consumption_intervall work all exactly as described above

#setupcost are the material requires when setting up this factory

#sort_time is the amount of time it takes for the sorter to sort one batch of items, where one batch is the sort amount specified
#in the config.

#sort_amount is the amount of items that gets sorted per run

#maximum_materials_per_side is an amount that limits how many items you can assign to a specific side (so the sorter sorts them
#in this direction)

factories:

#-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

#FCC recipes

#FCCs have a wide variety of different recipes with different functionality they can run. Those will be listed under the config
#option recipes, like this:

#recipes:
#   smeltstone:
#       name: well
#           ...
#   anotheridentifer:
#       name: weg
#           ...

#Every recipe has two configurations values, that always have to be specified, those are name and production_time.

#name can be any String, but it's not allowed to contain '#', because this is used internally. The name you give your recipe
#here has to be the same you used above to list a factorys recipes, even capitalization has to be the same.

#production_time is simply how long this recipe takes to complete one run


#Now on to the actual recipes:

#1. Productionrecipe

#This is the standard recipe; you put in materials, run the factory and get others as an output.

#An example:

#identiferABC:
#   type: PRODUCTION
#   name: Productionrecipeexample
#   production_time: 10s
#   input:
#       item1:
#           material: STONE
#   output:
#       outputstuff:
#           material: DIAMOND


#The type for recipes works exactly like the one for factories, each recipe has it's own unique identifer that has to be used.
#The one for production recipes is PRODUCTION.

#input is a list of items that gets consumed when the recipe completes, those items are required to even activate a factory
#with this recipe

#output is a list of items that will get returned after the the input materials were consumed.


#2. Compactionrecipe

#Compaction allows players to store large amounts of items easily. Whole stacks of items get compacted into single items marked
#with lore and those items are stackable. This means a player can keep up to 4096 items in a single inventory slot! The recipe
#to add the lore and reduce the stack to a single one is this one, the decompation recipe is used to reverse this process.

#An example:

#compactIdentifier:
#   type: COMPACT
#   name: Compact item
#   production_time 5s
#   input:
#       crate:
#           material: CHEST
#           lore:
#            - Crate
#   compact_lore: Compacted Item
#   excluded_materials:
#    - BOOK


#type always has to be COMPACT for this type of recipe

#input specifies the compaction cost, ergo items that are consumed addtionally to the stack which is turned into a single item

#compact_lore is the lore that will be added to the item to signalized that it's compacted

#excluded_materials allows you to list materials, which will not be compactable. Per default anything that has a stack size of 1,
#has lore or enchants is not compactable, but if you also want to prevent other items from being compactable, you can do that here.


#3. Decompactionrecipe

#Decompaction allows you to decompact items that were previously compacted. For a description of compaction see the compaction
#recipe.

#Example:

#decompactedIdentifier:
#   type:DECOMPACT
#   name: Decompaction recipe
#   production_time: 5s
#   input:
#   compact_lore: Compact Item


#type always has to be DECOMPACT here. 

#input is a list of items that get consumed as decompaction cost

#compact_lore is the lore that is required on the compacted item. Ensure that the lore here and the one in the compaction recipe
#are the same.


#4. Repairrecipe

#Repair recipes allow repairing their factory. Once a factory is at 0 health, the only recipe that can be run is the repair
#recipe.

#Example config:

#hurryItsAboutToBreak:
#   type: REPAIR
#   name: Repair factory
#   production_time: 20s
#   input:
#       diamonds:
#           material: DIAMOND
#           amount: 576
#   health_gained: 50


#type always has to be REPAIR for this.

#Input is as usual a list of items, which will be consumed when the recipe completes.

#health_gained is the amount of health that will be restored by a successfull run. 10000 means fully health here


#5. Upgraderecipe

#Upgrades recipes allow you to upgrade one factory into another to completly change it's recipes and properties

#Example:

#upgrading:
#   type: UPGRADE
#   production_time: 1d
#   name: Upgrade to super duper factory
#   input:
#       diamond:
#           material: DIAMOND
#           amount: 64
#   factory: upgradedsmelter

#type always has to be UPGRADE

#input is again the list of items which are consumed

#factory is the name of the factory it's supposed to be upgraded to. This factory must have been specified as FCCUPGRADE
#above and the name here and above has to be exactly the same.


#6. Enchantingrecipe

#Enchanting recipes allow factories to apply enchants to items. Instead of just consuming a blank tool to produce an enchanted
#one the way it would be possible with enchanted tools, this actually applies the enchant. This can also be used to increase the
#level of an already existing enchant 

#Example:

#enchanting:
# type: ENCHANT
# name: Enchant with Effiency 5
# production_time: 10s
# input:
#   diamond:
#     material: DIAMOND
#     amount: 50
# enchant: DIG_SPEED
# level: 5
# enchant_item:
#   tool:
#     material: DIAMOND_PICKAXE

#type has to be ENCHANT for this recipe

#name is the name of the recipe displayed ingame

#input are additional items which are consumed as a cost to enchant the item

#enchant is the enchant which is applied to the item, use official spigot identifers for this:
#https://hub.spigotmc.org/javadocs/spigot/org/bukkit/enchantments/Enchantment.html

#level is the level of the enchant, if not specified this will default to 1

#enchant_item is the item to which the enchant is applied. This can just be a blank tool, if you want this enchant to be appliable
#to any tool of this material or you can give this item an enchant with the same type as this recipe, but of a different level to use
#this recipe as an upgrade to the enchant


#7. Randomized output recipe

#Random recipes allow you to specify multiple different outputs for a recipe and to assign a certain chance to each. The sum of all the
#chances should always be 1.0

#Optionally use "display:" to pick which output to show in the GUI; otherwise the least-likely option
# will be shown.

#Example:

#random:
# type: RANDOM
# production_time: 2s
# name: Stone or Dirt
# input:
#   diamond:
#     material: DIAMOND
# outputs:
#   display: second
#   first:
#     chance: 0.5
#     dirt:
#       material: DIRT
#   second:
#     chance: 0.5
#     dirt:
#       material: STONE

#type has to be RANDOM here

#input are the materials consumed

#output is a list of item configurations with a chance for it each. It's important to note here that the items themselves still need be a level lower
#yaml structure wise than the chance

recipes:



#Sometimes you will want to rename existing factories. Just changing the name in the config and restarting the server will delete all existing 
#factories of this type though, so instead you can here specify factories, which you on startup want to rename/convert into a different one

#Example format:

#renames:
#  example1:
#    oldName: Stone Smelter With Bad Name
#    newName: Stone Smelter
#  example2:
#    oldName: tempName
#    newName: Emerald Extractor

#oldName is the previous name and newName is the one the factory will be converted to. The configuration for the factory with the oldName has to be 
#removed from the config already, otherwise the name won't be changed and the old configuration for the factory will be loaded. The renaming feature
#will work for all types of factories, not only FCCs

renames:


#CivMenu configuration

#This plugin uses CivMenu (https://github.com/civcraft/CivMenu) to display additional information to players. You can specify
#the messages sent to the players here. Note that for all those events a short message to sum it up will already be displayed,
#this is only meant to provide messages to teach the game mechanic as a whole.

CivMenu:
