# KiraBukkitGateway
KiraBukkitGateway is a Minecraft plugin used to relay in-game information through RabbitMQ to the Kira Discord bot. 

You can set keywords in the KiraBukkitGateway's config that the plugin will look for and send to the Kira Discord Bot. This is useful for moderation, for example you can set a relay so that anytime a player on your server says "dox" you will see the message in a designated Discord channel. This plugin is also used to run commands in-game or on the server console from Discord through Kira. 



This plugin is currently on Minecraft version 1.16.5.
