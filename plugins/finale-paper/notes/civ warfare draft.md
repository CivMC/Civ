# Finale 2.1 2nd Draft

## Fixes
- Fixed CPS inflation when swinging at certain blocks.

## Existing

### Warp Fruit
- Added option to deliver effects to player upon warping back to the previous location. With this feature, effects like slowness can be given for a brief period as a counterbalance if this tool is too strong.

### Combat Block Placement Restrictions
There is one glaring issue with respect to strict block placement restrictions, and that is, during a battle and after a skirmish, how are the attackers supposed to advance fortifications if they need to wait out a combat tag timer?

#### Zoning
Block restrictions have a new option called zoning. Instead of not being able to place blocks at all while combat tagged regardless of whether there are enemies near you; 

Instead of restricting block placement entirely, block restrictions can apply within a [x]-metre zone around players that are in combat and don't have you marked as an ally. If you set zone radius to -1 or don't specify a zone, then zoning doesn't apply.

### Crossbow
To prevent stealth breaks, adding notifications to crossbow anti-citadel and anti-bastion damage.

## New

### Gapple Cooldown
- Added option for gapple cooldown.

### Options for Lingering Potions
- Added option to modify duration.

### Custom Armour Effects
Want to give players perma fire resistance when they borne full netherite? This feature lets you do that.

### New Combat Block Restrictions
- Added option to disable ctr and ctf while combat tagged.
