/**
 * Plugins should replace their custom Database handlers with an instance of ManagedDatasource.
 * 
 * See the {@link #ManagedDatasource} constructor for details on how to use the ManagedDatasource.
 * 
 * To convert existing plugins, do the following:
 *
 * <ol><li> Take existing database version code and refactor it.
 * <ol><li> Any CREATE, UPDATE, ALTER, or similar statements, convert
 * to a List of Strings and pass them into ManagedDatasource as a Migration using
 * {@link #registerMigration(int, boolean, String...)}</li>
 * <li>Find your prepared statements. Convert the string resources as static final in your plugin's DAO layer.</li>
 * <li>Remove any "is database alive" check code. It's not needed.</li>
 * <li>Remove any version management code that remains</li>
 * <li>DO react to the results of the {@link #updateDatabase} call.
 * <ol><li> If false is returned, terminate your plugin. <li>
 * <li>If false is returned and your plugin is critical to a host of other plugins, terminate the server.</li>
 * <li>If an Exception is thrown, I strongly recommend you consider it a "false" return value and react 
 * accordingly.</li></ol></li>
 * <li>Note: Create a "first" migration at index -1 that ignores errors and copies
 * any "current" migration state data from the db_version or equivalent table into the <code>managed_plugin_data</code>
 * table.</li></ol></li>
 * <li>Throughout your plugin, ensure that PreparedStatements are "created" new each request and against a newly
 * retrieved Connection (using {@link #getConnection()} of this class). Don't worry about PrepareStatements. The driver
 * will manage caching them efficiently.</li>
 * <li>Make sure you release Connections using {@link Connection#close()} as soon as you can 
 * (when done with them).
 * <ol><li>Don't hold on to Connections.</li>
 * <li>Close them.</li>
 * <li>Use "try-with-resources" where-ever possible so that they are auto-closed.</li></ol></li>
 * <li>If you have loops to insert a bunch of similar records, convert
 * it to a batch. Find instructions in {@link #ManagedDatasource}.</li>
 * <li>If you have special needs like atomic
 * multi-statement, do all your work on a single Connection and return it to a clean state when you are done. (turn
 * auto-commit back on, ensure all transactions are committed, etc.)</li></ol>
 *
 * That should cover most cases. Note that points 2 and 3 are critical. Point 1 is required. Point 4 and 5 are highly
 * recommended.

	/**
	 * Create a new ManagedDatasource.
	 *
	 * After creating, a plugin should register its migrations, which are numbered "sets" of queries that ensure that
	 * the database has the required tables, procedures, etc, for your plugin to function correctly. Migrations will be
	 * iterated through in ascending order during first setup, and whenever newer migrations have been added relative
	 * to your current setup. Think of them like patches, that each one builds off and modifies what came before it, so
	 * it's recommended that your migrations be non-destructive of existing data. Though writing good migrations does
	 * not absolve you of needing to back up your data... when was the last time you backed up? You should probably run
	 * a back up.
	 *
	 * Use {@link #registerMigration(int, boolean, Callable, String...)} to add a new migration.
	 *
	 * When you are done adding, call {@link #updateDatabase()} which gets a lock on migrating for this plugin, then
	 * checks if any migrations need to be applied, and applies as needed.
	 *
	 * Now, your database connection pool will be ready to use!
	 *
	 * Don't worry about "pre-preparing" statements. Just use the following pattern:
	 *
	 * {@code
	 *   try (Connection connection = myManagedDatasource.getConnection();
	 *   		PreparedStatement statement = connection.prepareStatement("SELECT * FROM sample;");) {
	 *   	// code that uses that -^ statement
	 *   }
	 *   catch (SQLException exception) {
	 *   	// code that alerts on failure
	 *   }
	 * }
	 *
	 * Or similar w/ normal Statements. This is a try-with-resources block, and it ensures that once the query is
	 * complete (even if it errors!) all resources are "closed". In the case of the connection pool, this just returns
	 * the connection back to the connection pool for use elsewhere.
	 *
	 * If you want to batch, just use a PreparedStatement as illustrated above, and use {@code .addBatch();} on it
	 * after adding each set of parameters. When you are done, call {@code .executeBatch();} and all the statements
	 * will be executed in order. Be sure to watch for errors or warnings and of course read the PreparedStatement API
	 * docs for any further questions.
	 *
	 * @param plugin The plugin whose database is being managed.
	 * @param credentials The credentials to connect to the database with.
	 * @return Returns
