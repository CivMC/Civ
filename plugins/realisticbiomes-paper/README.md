Limits plant growth and animal reproduction to their naturally occuring biomes, or reasonable ones for plants that do not occur naturally. Growth is persistent, so plants grow even when not connected.

See [this spreadsheet](https://civcraft.github.io/RealisticBiomes/spreadsheet/) for the default configuration of the different plants, animals and actions. This is also the configuration on the [civcraft](http://civcraft.github.io/civcraftsite/) server.

See [the wiki](https://github.com/Civcraft/RealisticBiomes/wiki) for in depth explanation of the mechanics.
