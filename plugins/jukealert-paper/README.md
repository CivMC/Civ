# JukeAlert

A plugin for Minecraft 1.10 that turns Noteblocks and Jukeboxes into snitches that record player entries and actions.

## Usage

- Reinforce a **Noteblock** with a [Citadel](https://github.com/DevotedMC/Citadel) reinforcement to create an entry snitch. The snitch will send a notification to everyone on the Citadel group its reinforced to when other players enter its field - an 11 block cube centered on the snitch.

- Reinforce a **Jukebox** with a [Citadel](https://github.com/DevotedMC/Citadel) reinforcement to create a snitch. The snitch will send a notification to everyone on the Citadel group its reinforced to when other players enter its field - an 11 block cube centered on the snitch. It will also record player actions that occur within the field, e.g. block placement and destruction. Type `/jainfo` to check what players did in the snitched area while you were gone.
