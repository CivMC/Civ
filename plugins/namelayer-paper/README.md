# NameLayer

Allows the creation of configurable, permission-based, player-made groups in Minecraft. From buildings to chat messages, one can selectivity restrict or expand which players are on group and their level of access.

Example Usage:
* Chat messages which can only be seen by the group of people you chose to allow.
* Doors which can only be opened by the group of people you chose to allow.

See the wiki for details on group creation, management, and other commands: https://github.com/CivClassic/NameLayer/wiki
