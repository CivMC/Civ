#BanStick

Tired of those pesky VPNers and VPSers?

Me too.

Ban 'em, investigate and ban their providers, breath easy again.

--------

#Main features:
* Supports range-bans: Ban players by name, IP address, and subnet -- also ban a player's entire subnet with a single command.
* Supports auto-VPN/VPS flagging: Growing list of vpn/vps range loading for easy vpn / vps proxy flagging. 
* Supports scraping of anon proxies: Scrape a number of anonymous proxy providers in a sustainable interval.
* Supports grabbing of up-to-date Tor exit nodes: Good Tor ban citizen, only grabs and blocks Tor exit notes, configurably.
* Supports automatic grabbing of IP geodata: Uses a batch-request service to never exceed TOS while still providing quality IP geo data.
* Easy expansion: VPN/VPS/Proxy list, HTML Proxy list Scraping, and Tor exit scrapers are easily expanded to include new sources.
* Automatic multi-account support and banning: Set a valid limit of multi-accounts with auto-banning of new accounts that exceed that limit.
* Easily manage existing bans, exemptions by ban class (IP / Proxy / Share)
* Import data from IP-Check (room for expansion to other tools) including preserving pardons / exclusions
