### CivSpy for Bungee
-------------

CivSpy for Bungee is still fairly nascient. Although like CivSpy for Bukkit it leverages the power of HikariCP's connection pool, at present it lacks any of the scaled-out infrastructure of CivSpy Bukkit. 

Currently, it simply records login, logout, and session times at the network level.
