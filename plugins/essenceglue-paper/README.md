Daily login rewards and voting rewards. Minecraft Plugin built for Paper 1.16.5

## Description

Allows configurable daily login or voting rewards. Allows configuration of an amount of time to be logged in before it will give the daily login reward. Also allows configuration for login streak rewards to increase the reward each consecutive day you login. Operates on a bitwise function to determine your reward. Thus if you login for 7 days in a row, receiving a total of 8 login reward (essence), and then you miss a day, you will drop to 7 essence a day until you have once again reached a total of 7 consecutive days of claiming the reward.
