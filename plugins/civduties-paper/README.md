# CivDuties
Minecraft plugin built for Paper 1.16.5

Custom plugin used to assign a limited range of moderation permissions for players. Used on CivClassic as a tool to allow designated player-moderators to use /duty to enter a mode which allows them to teleport and move around in spectator mode to investigate hacking. Also allows them to run commands such as kicking or banning while in /duty mode.
