# Bastions
Bastions are special blocks made in a factory that produce a field of protection around themselves. There are two different kinds of bastions: 

## City Bastion

City Bastions prevent reinforcement and placement of fluids and certain entities such as boats within their range. They are typically used to protect large areas due to their low cost and large (100x100) area of effect.

The recipe for city bastions can be found in the /fm menu.

## Vault Bastion

Vault bastions inherit all the effects of city bastions, but also prevent all other placements. They are typically used in small areas which require extra protection.
