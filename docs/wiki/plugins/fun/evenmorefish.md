# EvenMoreFish
EvenMoreFish is a plugin that expands on the vanilla fishing experience. While all vanilla drops are still available, including extra vanilla drops too, EvenMoreFish adds a huge amount of new fishes, decorations, creatures, and more. All in the form of player heads.

## Types of drops
Using any kind of fishing rod, you can get different kinds of drops from fishing.

### Vanilla+
This includes all the drops from vanilla fishing. Including junk, fish and treasures. 
It also adds new item drops, like emeralds as treasures. These items will display a special description in chat but will behave as regular items in the inventory.
### Junk
This type of drop includes all kinds of decorations, from actual junk, like a trash bag, to a bag of gold coins. Including foods, flowers, toys, etc.

All the items below this category can be caught fishing anywhere around the world.

### Event
During some events, special items can be fished up by players. For example, Christmas decorations during Christmas. These items follow the same rules as Junk items, but are only available during the event.

### Fish
Of course, EvenMoreFish adds more fishes. These fishes will display their rarity, size, weight and who captured them.
Some can be found anywhere, while others are affected by biome requirements.
These requirements follow two rules: water type and temperature.

Water types:
1- Seawater
2- Fresh water

Temperature:
1- Cold
2- Temperate
3- Warm

Their rarity can be:
1- Uncommon (green)
2- Rare (blue)
3- Legendary (yellow)

### Rare Animals
This refers to some biome-specific drops in the form of animals, insects and other creatures.
These animals will display the same information as Fish drops. The only difference is that they are all the rare type, and that they follow a different biome categorization.

In the case of Rare Animals, they spawn in one of seven different regions, each including a few different biomes. These regions are:

1- Desert
2- Coast
3- Forest
4- Mountain
5- Polar
6- Tropic
7- Grassland

## Other Changes

### Enchantments
Luck of the Sea doesn't affect the chances for capturing different heads, items or treasures. Instead, baits will be added in future to provide bonus chances to catch these. 

### Block Rules
The plugin allows for all the drops to be caught in any body of water (following the previously mentioned rules). Even if water is but a single source block.

### Auto Fisher
Are completely disabled.
