# options:
# date-format SHORT/MEDIUM/LONG/FULL SHORT/MEDIUM/LONG/FULL
# date/time formats are any of short/medium/long/full, twice, separated by a space
# the first is the length of the date format and the second, the time format.
# custom-date-format <FORMAT>
# these give you more control over your date formats
# documentation for custom date formats: https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/text/SimpleDateFormat.html
# in <type> [months] [weeks] [days] [hours] [minutes] [seconds]
# this will show something like "5 hours, 2 minutes" for "in 2 days hours minutes seconds"
# you can include a ? like "minutes?" so that it only shows if the next greatest time period is zero
# for example,  "in minutes seconds?" can show "2 minutes" or "59 seconds" but not "1 minute 4 seconds"
# The types affect the formatting, these are what they look like
# Type 1: "5 hours, 3 minutes and 20 seconds"
# Type 2: "5 hours, 2 minutes, 1 second"
# Type 3: "1 hour 5 minutes"
# Type 4: "1h, 5m and 3s"
# Type 5: "4h, 2m, 2s"
# Type 6: "3h 7m 6s"
# Type 7: "8h2m4s"
#
# you will want different formats depending on how long you want your deathbans to be
# if you don't quite understand, there are many examples
